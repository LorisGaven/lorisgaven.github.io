In connection with the 'Leadership' courses taught at school, I interviewed a person who had responsibilities and had to take care of a team

### How do you handle non-performance issues within your team?

When non-performance issues arise within my team, I acknowledge the issue and work with the team to identify the root cause. I then suggest ways to improve and provide feedback to team members who may not be meeting expectations.

### How do you manage conflicts within your team?

Conflicts are not a frequent issue in my team. However, when conflicts do arise, I encourage team members to communicate with each other and express their viewpoints. I then ask them to suggest commitments to prevent similar issues in the future.

### Can you describe your leadership style and approach to leading a team?

My leadership style is based on clear communication and frequent interactions with my team. I believe in providing guidance, setting expectations, and fostering open communication among team members so that everyone knows what to do and why to do it.

### What performance metrics do you use to measure your team's success?

The performance metrics I use to measure my team's success vary depending on the project, and may include metrics such as meeting project deadlines, achieving project goals, maintaining quality standards, and receiving positive feedback from stakeholders.

### How do you define success within a team?

For me, a successful team is one where team members willingly offer assistance to each other, work collaboratively, and go beyond their assigned duties to achieve project goals. A positive team culture where everyone feels valued and contributes to the team's success is a key indicator of success.

### Can you share some mistakes you have made as a team leader?

One mistake I made as a team leader was initially micromanaging team members' work and being overly demanding, which undervalued the importance of recognizing and rewarding effective work. I learned from this mistake and now focus on empowering team members and recognizing their contributions.

### What do you find the most challenging in your role as a team leader?

One of the most challenging aspects of my role as a team leader is managing team members who do not work well as a team. It can be difficult to communicate with them and encourage collaboration, but I actively work on fostering a positive team environment and facilitating effective communication among team members.

### What advice would you give to someone who aspires to be a team leader?

My advice would be to listen to your team and ensure that everyone feels involved and valued in the projects. Also, be responsive and proactive in addressing any problems or challenges that arise, and focus on empowering and recognizing the contributions of team members to foster a positive and successful team culture.
