<h3>My Project</h3>
<hr>
As an engineering student, I have always been fascinated by the possibilities of artificial intelligence and machine learning. The idea of creating intelligent systems that can learn and adapt on their own has always captivated me, and I believe that AI has the potential to revolutionize virtually every industry and aspect of our lives.
I am particularly interested in the field of reinforcement learning, which focuses on developing algorithms and systems that can learn from their experiences and make decisions in complex, uncertain environments. I believe that this area of research has enormous potential to shape the future of AI and bring about a wide range of benefits, including more efficient and effective decision-making, greater automation, and the ability to solve complex problems that would be difficult or impossible for humans to tackle on their own.
I want to work in AI research because I want to be at the forefront of this exciting field and contribute to the development of these technologies. I believe that my skills and knowledge as an engineering student make me well-suited to this field, and I am eager to apply my skills and knowledge to make a difference in the world. I am confident that a career in AI research will allow me to make a meaningful contribution to society and make a positive impact on the world.

<h3>A First Experience</h3>
<hr>
For my M1 internship, I contacted the SuReLI team at ISAE Supaero, which works on this field. We discussed potential research topics and I found a subject that interested me. It will be for me the opportunity to have a real first experience on this field and potentially a first scientific publication.

<h3>Future & International Mobility</h3>
<hr>
For my M2 I plan to do a research-oriented master's degree, I have found a certain master's degree that interests me in Paris to which I will apply. After this master I would like to do an internship in a research laboratory abroad and potentially pursue a PhD in this lab afterwards.
