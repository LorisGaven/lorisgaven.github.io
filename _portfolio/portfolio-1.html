<h3>The problem</h3>
<hr/>
<p>
We hava a standard gridworld, with start and goal states, but with one difference: 
there is a crosswind upward through the middle of the grid. The actions are the standard four—up, down, right, and left 
but in the middle region the resultant next states are shifted upward by a “wind,” 
the strength of which varies from column to column. The strength of the wind is given below each column, in number of cells shifted upward.
For example, if you are one cell to the right of the goal, then the action left takes you to the cell just above the goal.
